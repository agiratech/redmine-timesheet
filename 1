    # If user switching support is enabled, then Phusion Passenger will by default run the web application as the owner if the file config/environment.rb (for Rails apps) or config.ru (for Rack apps). This option allows you to override that behavior and explicitly set a user to run the web application as, regardless of the ownership of environment.rb/config.ru.

    # By default, Phusion Passenger does not start any application instances until said web application is first accessed. The result is that the first visitor of said web application might experience a small delay as Phusion Passenger is starting the web application on demand. If that is undesirable, then this directive can be used to pre-started application instances during Apache startup.
